	Cache Memory Simulatior - Documentation
	
=======================================================

Requirements:
-------------
>> create a system that simulates performance and communication of cache memory
   with data persistence
>> system consists of 4 components:
	Writer        
	Dumping Buffer
	Historical    
	Reader	      
>> all activities in system should be logged

Development:
------------
>> Project will be written in C#
>> Agile framework is used in development
>> The whole process is divided into 4 sprints:
	> S1 (10.05-16.05) -> documentation,diagrams and base project
	> S2 (17.05-23.05) 
	> S3 (24.05-30.05)
	> S4 (31.05-06.06)
    *details of sprints 2-4 will be discussed on the next scrum meeting
>> Solution consists of these components:
	> Writer -> writing data into the Dumping buffer
	> DumpingBuffer -> temporary data container; forwards data to Historical
	> Historical -> writing into the database
	> Reader -> reading data from database
	> Logger -> logging activities
>> Database will be used for storing information

>> How does the system work?
	> Writer sends data to DumpingBuffer every 2 seconds
	> Data can be either randomly generated (WriteToDumpingBuffer) or manually written (ManualWriteToDummpingBuffer)
	> In DumpingBuffer data is stored in collection CollectionDescription
	> It cointains DumpingPropertyCollection, DataSet and unique ID
	> DataSet is determined based on Codes
		DataSet = 1 – CODE_ANALOG, CODE_DIGITAL
		DataSet = 2 – CODE_CUSTOM, CODE_LIMITSET
		DataSet = 3 – CODE_SINGLENODE, CODE_MULTIPLENODE
		DataSet = 4 – CODE_CONSUMER, CODE_SOURCE
		DataSet = 5 – CODE_MOTION, CODE_SENSOR 
	> If new data has the same Code but different value, old value will be updated
	> When 2 different values are accumulated within the same DataSet, data is forwarded to DeltaCD and CD is freed
	> After Writer sends 10 data packages, DeltaCD is forwarded to Historical(if it has at least 1 component, if not,
	  it waits for another 10 packages to be sent)
	> When Historical recives data, it writes it in it's structures and validates it
	> Then it checks if data meets conditions to be written in database
